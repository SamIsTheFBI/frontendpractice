				<h2>How to navigate</h2>	
				<p>To check out what I have made, click on any link in the below list. They all lead a webpage which has the component I made.</p>
				<p>Upon viewing one, you can just return to this page using your browser's back button.</p>
				<h2>Why this look?</h2>
				<p>You might ask why I opted for this old styled look. No it's not the lack of knowledge modern web design. And no, those links above won't lead to similar looking webpages. The purpose behind this minimalism was to show that basic HTML/CSS can help you achieve a lot. A website doesn't exactly need to be filled with shiny gradients or that parallax motion.</p>
